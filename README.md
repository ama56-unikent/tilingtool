# Tiling Tool

## Description
Tiling Tool is a free web app, a visual tool for creating grids. Currently, it uses the old bootstrap grid, but this could be changed in the future. This tool is still in its initial development, but there is also a [demo](http://amirmohsen.github.io/tilingtool/) available which is constantly updated with new features as I do more development.

## TODO
* Finish the resizing feature
* Add a help feature that explains how the tool should be used
* Rename all references from Tiling Tool to just "Tiles"
* Clean up the code and the files into subdirectories and classes after inital development
* Convert CSS to Less
* Separate specific features from the actual app
* Add undo/redo
* Add new Bootstrap grids alongside the old one
